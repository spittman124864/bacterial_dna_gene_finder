# bacterial_dna_gene_finder
Python code to analyze bacterial dna strand and locate gene using unsupervised learning techniques.

The notebook, DNA_Analysis.ipynb, provides the codes to upload a DNA sequence, separate the sequence into codon's of varying lengths (1,2,3 (genetic code), and measure various quantities to find the location of a gene in a bacterial DNA.

The notebook uploads the DNA sequence in the text file, Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_genomic.txt.  

The pdf file, dna-genome-analysis.pdf, is a short write-up of the entire project with background on DNA.
